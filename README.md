# Encryption-App
A Python-based desktop application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using multiple cipher techniques through an intuitive graphical interface built with Tkinter.

Users enter a message, select an encryption method, and choose whether to encrypt or decrypt. Depending on the selected cipher, additional inputs (shift or password) are dynamically enabled. The processed result is displayed in real time.

## Features
- Caesar Cipher with user-defined shift
- Symbol Cipher using custom character mapping
- Password-based Cipher (polyalphabetic-style encryption)
- Encrypt and decrypt modes
- Copy encrypted/decrypted text to clipboard
- Clean, dark-themed GUI for usability

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter (GUI)
